# Largest Series Product

Write a program that, when given a string of digits, can calculate the largest product for a contiguous substring of digits of length n.

For example, for the input `'1027839564'`, the largest product for a
series of 3 digits is 270 (9 * 5 * 6), and the largest product for a
series of 5 digits is 7560 (7 * 8 * 3 * 9 * 5).

Note that these series are only required to occupy *adjacent positions*
in the input; the digits need not be *numerically consecutive*.

For the input `'73167176531330624919225119674426574742355349194934'`,
the largest product for a series of 6 digits is 23520.
